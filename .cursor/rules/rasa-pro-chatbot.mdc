# Rasa Pro Chatbot Integration Rule

## Overview
This rule describes the integration of a smart chatbot using Rasa Pro for the TOEIC Duel App. The chatbot will support vocabulary lookup, grammar explanations, conversation topic suggestions, study reminders, and TOEIC-related Q&A. It must be real-time, user-friendly for Vietnamese users, and easily extensible.

## Key Requirements
- Integrate Rasa Pro backend (hosted/cloud or self-hosted).
- Communicate between app and Rasa via API ([REST/websocket](mdc:credentials.yml)).
- User-friendly chat UI: send/receive messages, quick replies, buttons, images.
- Support main intents: vocabulary lookup, grammar explanation, study reminders, TOEIC Q&A, small talk.
- Support Vietnamese and English.
- Store conversation history.
- Send study reminders via chatbot.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design conversation flows** (intents, entities, main TOEIC flows).
2. **Configure and deploy Rasa Pro server** (cloud/self-hosted).
3. **Create API proxy or direct connection** ([credentials.yml](mdc:credentials.yml)).
4. **Build chat UI** (Chatbot component, quick reply, loading, etc.).
5. **Integrate message sending/receiving between app and Rasa.**
6. **Handle main intents:** vocabulary, grammar, reminders, small talk.
7. **Store conversation history** (local/cloud as needed).
8. **Test conversation, UX, edge cases.**
9. **Optimize performance and chat UX/UI.**

## Potential Challenges
- Ensure low latency, real-time chat.
- Handle natural Vietnamese, context disambiguation.
- Secure API, user authentication.
- Optimize chat UI for mobile, support various message types (text, button, image).
- Easy extensibility for new intents/flows.

## Testing Strategy
- Test intents, entities, conversation flows with various scenarios.
- Test chat UX/UI on multiple devices.
- Test network errors, reconnect, timeout.
- Evaluate intent accuracy and chatbot responses.

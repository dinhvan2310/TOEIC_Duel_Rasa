# Rasa Slots Documentation

## Overview
Slots are your assistant's memory. They act as a key-value store which can be used to store information the user provided (e.g. their home city) as well as information gathered about the outside world (e.g. the result of a database query).

## Slot Types

### Text Slot
A text slot can take on any string value.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  word:
    type: text
    description: The word to look up
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
```

### Boolean Slot
A boolean slot can only take on the values `true` or `false`. This is useful when you want to store a binary value.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  word_saved:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
```

### List Slot
A list slot can take on a list of values. This is useful for storing multiple items.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  example_questions:
    type: list
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
```

## Slot Mappings

### from_llm
The `from_llm` mapping type allows slots to be filled with values generated by LLM-based command generators. This is the default slot mapping type if mappings are not explicitly defined.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  word:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
```

### controlled
The `controlled` mapping type is used when the slot value is set by custom actions or other controlled processes.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  word_meaning:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
```

## Real-Time Slot Validation
You can define validation rules that are strictly independent of business logic directly in the domain file. These rules enforce constraints on slot values when they are collected during the conversation in real time.

Example:
```yaml
slots:
  phone_number:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
    validation:
      rejections:
        - if: not (slots.phone_number matches "^\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$")
          utter: utter_invalid_phone_number
      refill_utter: "utter_refill_phone_number"
```

## Best Practices
1. Use descriptive slot names that clearly indicate their purpose
2. Add descriptions to slots to document their usage
3. Choose appropriate slot types based on the data you need to store
4. Use validation rules to ensure data quality
5. Consider using `from_llm` mappings for flexible slot filling
6. Use `controlled` mappings when you need precise control over slot values

## Example from TOEIC Duel
Here's a practical example from the TOEIC Duel application:

```yaml
slots:
  word:
    type: text
    description: The word to look up
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
  word_meaning:
    type: text
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
  word_saved:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
  save_word_confirmation:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
  example_questions:
    type: list
    mappings:
      - type: controlled
  show_examples_confirmation:
    type: bool
    mappings:
      - type: from_llm
```

This example shows how different slot types and mappings are used together to create a word lookup and vocabulary management system.

        (Please answer: **yes** or **no**)

        - title: "Yes"
          payload: "/SetSlots(understand_1=true)"
        - title: "No"
          payload: "/SetSlots(understand_1=false)"
  utter_explain_more_1:
    - text: |
        üßÆ Countable nouns are things or people you can count individually.
        For example:

        ‚úÖ Correct! **'apple'** is a countable noun.
  utter_incorrect_q1:
    - text: |
        ‚ùå Not quite. The correct answer is **'apple' (A)** because it can be counted.
